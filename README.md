# Description

Electricity Connect is a student puzzle game developed over one month.
The main objective of the project is to create a fast and simple puzzle experience
based on connecting electrical circuits.

## Features
- Connect electricity through wires
- Use cubes to connect separated wires
- Use levers to modify wire paths

## Technologies
- Unity 2022
- C#

## What I Learned
- Sending information across multiple connected objects
- Checking collisions efficiently using coroutines

## Future Improvements
- Use interfaces so systems like levers are not tied to specific objects
  and can be reused for any interactable element

## Current State
Student project / technical demo
